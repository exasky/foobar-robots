# Foobar exploitation capitalizm
### Launch

```sh
git clone git@github.com:exasky/foobar-robots.git
cd foobar-robots
npm i
node dist/index.js
```

### Remarks
I took 4 hours to do the project because I 'lost' 2 hours in the beginning trying to do the project with observables, factory pattert and strategy pattern.
After those 2 hours, I finally started to think... And told to myself: no please don't over engineer the project. Do something simple and efficient.
